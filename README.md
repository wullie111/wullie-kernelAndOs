#WillieKernerl/os

the wullie kernel and os is made by william morrison in java. its disinged to replace Linux but not to overtake it.
all the code is open-sorce so bug fixescan be made fasster. most of the games and librarys willbe made by me for a start but anyone can make more.
right now the iso has to be hand compiled so DO NOT COMPLAIN that there is no iso 
once there is a full relese then I will compile and create the iso
